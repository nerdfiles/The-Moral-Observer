The following text should dispose the reader to a discursive strategy for the experimental discovery of amorality in the 
modern hominids, à la George Edward Moore's "Naturalistic Fallacy" and the precedence of the concept of _moral luck_ à la 
Bernard Williams. Such an effort may be treated as a _compossibility analysis_ of the roles of chance and law-like 
determination evident in the uncheck'd consistency of moral predicates as they arise within advanced, or sophisticated, 
social systems.
