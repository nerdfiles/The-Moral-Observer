#Foreword

The following text should dispose the reader to a discursive strategy for the experimental discovery of amorality in 
the modern hominids, à la George Edward Moore's "Naturalistic Fallacy" and the precedence of the concept of _moral 
luck_ à la Bernard Williams. Such an effort may be treated as a _compossibility analysis_ of the roles of chance and 
law-like determination evident in the uncheck'd consistency of moral predicates as they arise within advanced, or 
sophisticated, social systems.

Of course, a reading of the aforementioned authors may prime or prepare the reader for the given philosophical 
strategy; however, a rigorous reading of those texts, Principia Ethica or the majority of Bernard Williams' works, 
are by no means necessary for the proper consumption of the following text, as it will be of utmost intent in the 
author to expound and elucidate the given ideas for a general or wide, but not necessarily "popular" audience. Indeed, 
the following text should least of all be treated as a work of fashionable or introductory philosophy, but rather an 
extension to ideas intuited, in the author's own perceptions, as constituting part of the fabric of everyday discourse, 
although perhaps obscured by the trends and motions of modern intellectual posturings.
