#The Moral Observer

A discursive strategy for the experimental discovery of amorality in the hominids à la George Edward Moore's Naturalistic Fallacy and the precedence of the concept of moral luck à la Bernard Williams. It may be treated as a compossibility analysis of the roles of chance and law-like determination evident in uncheck'd consistency of moral predicates.
