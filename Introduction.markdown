The following work will dispose the reader to a discursive strategy for the experimental discovery of amorality in the 
hominids à la George Edward Moore's Naturalistic Fallacy and the precedence of the concept of moral luck à la Bernard 
Williams. Such an effort may be treated as a _compossibility analysis_ of the roles of chance and law-like 
determination evident in uncheck'd consistency of moral predicates.
